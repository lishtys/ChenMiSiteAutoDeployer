Greetings, I'm Chen Mi, a game engineer and a graduate student at University of Utah, going to receive the master degree from the Entertainment Arts and Engineering Program in May 2019. 

Currently, I work in the Therapeutic Games and Apps Lab. Our team received funding from V.A. National Innovators Network to create the Surgical Safety System with V.A. Health Care System Center, which is being deployed in Salt Lake City.

Before studying in the MEAE program, I used to work in Beijing Boyhood Tech for 2 years as a unity engineer, where we shipped two multiple player mobile games: Pili Incredible, Era War, from which I learned great experience in game development, built up professional skills, familiar with work pipeline, forme the motivation for further study in game filed.

During my graduate study life, I developed my skills in game engineering. With the experience in Unity, I have built a datatable framework for The Red Moon, integrating with a basic server made by myself. Currently, with the interest of rendering, I'm working on CM_Engine project alone, and MEATY MCSKIN BONES using Unreal, shipping in Steam this summer.



I am also a member of Jiangxi Creative Entertainment Center. I joined there since undergraduate, where I focused the research on media interaction. My projects were awarded in Unity Awards, 2016 CUIDC, National Software Design Competition, etc. Due to the contribution, I was awarded as Person of the Year among college students in Jiangxi, 2014.

I like sharing experiences with others. I've delivered over  70 hours of game development courses online as well as documents localization, contributing to Chinese Unity community. During the internship in Shenzhen Empowerwin, I was a co-founder of Manew Edu, which now becomes one of the most significant game dev online education platform in China.


Besides, I love watch anime and movies in my spare time.
