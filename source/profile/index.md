> Greetings, Iâ€™m a game engineer at the [Therapeutic Games and Apps Lab ](https://library.med.utah.edu/synapse/gapp/)and going to graduate from the [Entertainment Arts and Engineering Program](https://games.utah.edu/) from the University of Utah in May 2019. 

> Our team receive funding from VA National Innovators to create the [Surgical Safety System](https://chenmi.ink/portfolio/Surgery_Checklist.html) with VA Health Care System Center. The project received Ensign College of Public Health Award with $15,000, being deployed in Salt Lake City.

# Experience

I've worked in Beijing as a game engineer and shipped two commercial mobile games: [Pili Incredible](https://chenmi.ink/portfolio/Pili_Incredible.html), and [Era War](https://chenmi.ink/portfolio/Era_War.html). I learned great industrial experience in game development, built up professional skills, familiarized with work pipeline, formed the motivation for further study in game filed.

During my graduate study life, I developed my skills in game engineering. I built a datatable framework for The Red Moon with the experience in Unity, integrating a basic server made by myself.

Currently, for interest in rendering, I'm working on [CM_Engine](http://chenmi.ink/portfolio/#Engine) project alone, and making [MEATY MCSKIN BONES](https://www.meatymcskinbones.com/blog) using Unreal, shipping on Steam this summer.

My projects were awarded by Unity Awards, 2016 CUID, etc. Due to the contribution, I was awarded as Person of the Year among college students in Jiangxi, 2014.


I like sharing experiences with others. I've delivered over  70 hours of game development courses online as well as documents localization, contributing to Chinese Unity community. During the internship in Shenzhen Empowerwin, I was a co-founder of [Manew Edu](http://edu.manew.com/), which now becomes one of the biggest game dev online education platform in China.
