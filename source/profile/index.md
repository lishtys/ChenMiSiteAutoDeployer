# Experience

I used to work in Beijing Boyhood Tech for 2 years as a unity engineer, having shipped two multiple player mobile games: Pili Incredible, Era War. I learned great industrial experience in game development, built up professional skills, familiar with work pipeline, forme the motivation for further study in game filed.


During my graduate study life, I developed my skills in game engineering. I built a datatable framework for The Red Moon with the experience in Unity, integrating a basic server made by myself.

Currently, for interest in rendering, I'm working on CM_Engine project alone, and making MEATY MCSKIN BONES using Unreal, shipping in Steam this summer.

# Activity & Hobby

I am also a member of Jiangxi Creative Entertainment Center. I joined there since undergraduate, focusing on the research of media interaction. My projects were awarded by Unity Awards, 2016 CUID, etc. Due to the contribution, I was awarded as Person of the Year among college students in Jiangxi, 2014.


I like sharing experiences with others. I've delivered over  70 hours of game development courses online as well as documents localization, contributing to Chinese Unity community. During the internship in Shenzhen Empowerwin, I was a co-founder of Manew Edu, which now becomes one of the biggest game dev online education platform in China.


Besides, I love watching anime and movies in my spare time.
