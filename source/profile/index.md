> Greetings! I'm a gameplay engineer previously worked in the [TCL Research America](https://www.tcl.com/us/en). Designed and established a text to 3D realtime anime movie generation tool using Unity (unannounced project).

Knowledge of networking and graphic rendering.    	     


# Experience

When studying  in University of Utah, Entertainment Arts and Engineering program, Our team received funding from VA National Innovators. In [The Therapeutic Games and Apps Lab](https://library.med.utah.edu/synapse/gapp/), we worked to create the [ Veterans Advanced Surgical Safety System](https://chenmi.ink/portfolio/Surgery_Checklist.html) with VA Health Care System Center. The project won a Ensign College of Public Health Award with $15,000, and has been deployed in Salt Lake City. This research experience broadens my view of software development and motivates me to explore new forms of adopting game dev skills.

Before that, I've worked in a game studio located in Beijing and published two mobile games mobile games: [Pili Incredible](https://chenmi.ink/portfolio/Pili_Incredible.html), and [Era War](https://chenmi.ink/portfolio/Era_War.html). I learned great practical experience from industry, built up professional skills, familiarized with the work pipeline and formed the motivation for further study in the game field from these two products.

# Activity

I am also a member of Jiangxi Creative Entertainment Center. I joined there as an undergraduate and did research on the digital arts interaction. It provided a great platform for me at an early stage. The  Kinect Virtual Lab won an official award from Unity Technology. Due to the contribution, I was awarded as Person of the Year among college students in Jiangxi, 2014.


I also like sharing experiences with others. I've delivered over 70 hours of game development courses online as well as documents localization, contributing to Chinese Unity community. During the internship in Shenzhen Empowerwin, I was a co-founder of [Manew Edu](http://edu.manew.com/), which now becomes one of the official partners with Unity Technology online education platforms in China.
