# Overview


We've created Surgery Checklist, a software suite for iOS and PC, that adds more features, and corrects many of the problems inherent to the paper checklist.

# Key Responsibility

1. We can track completion and adherence to the checklist protocol, and hospital administrators can easily identify problems with the use of the checklist without ever having to step foot in an operating room. PDF records are also automatically generated and exported so important documentation is never lost. 

2. We've created a securely encrypted QR scanning feature that ensures that the patient’s identity is correct, and contains important warnings and information pulled from the electronic health records such as allergies and medications. 

3. We've made a casting application. Surgery Checklist may be quickly, easily, and securely be wirelessly displayed on any monitor connected to a PC computer with a quick scan of a QR code.
