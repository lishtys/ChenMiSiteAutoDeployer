1. By using the suits hospital administrators can easily identify problems with the use of the checklist without ever having to step foot in an operating room. PDF records are also automatically generated and exported so important documentation is never lost. 

2. A securely encrypted QR scanning feature that ensures that the patientâ€™s identity is correct, and contains important warnings and information pulled from the electronic health records such as allergies and medications. 

3. A casting application. Implemented  P2P connection by UNET for wireless screen sharing in the operation room. The system can quickly, easily, and securely be displayed on any monitor connected to a PC computer with a quick scan of a QR code.
