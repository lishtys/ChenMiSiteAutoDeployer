# Overview

his project uses Kinect as the sensor to match powerful Unity game engine which has powerful human-computer interactive functions, and also applies it the to education and experiments. 

We build the scene by leading in models and controllingthe subjects logistically. Furthermore, we deploy the cross-platform project with the powerful Unity itself. 

By further analyzing and processing the image data that Kinect sensor has obtained, it gets spatial coordinates information, skeleton data and other information to track user's body joints to recognize the pose, and then combine Unity's engine to achieve module functions.
